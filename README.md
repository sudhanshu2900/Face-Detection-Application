This project based on Facial recognition and some analysis on face. This project uses some technologies and programming languages like-

    OpenCV
    HTML
    CSS
    Javascript
    Python
    Bootstrap

I used TensorflowJS, it is a Machine learning library for Javascript programmers. TensorflowJS helps in creating web based machine learning projects.

This project detect the face on image and live webcam of device. It also provide the interface of uploading and displaying image from local device. 

Project is distributed in three parts-
